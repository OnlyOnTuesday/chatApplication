* C++ Frontend Analysis
** Client 
*** did I connect to the server correctly
*** can I read json correctly (from memory)
** Class
*** need abstract class for the guis
**** qt and ncurses
*** maybe need class for normal things (I think so)

** Model View Controller
*** Model
**** Handles data, does not care how it is represented, simply receives and sends it.
**** Independent of View and Controller
*** View 
**** Knows how to present data to user
**** needs access to Model and to define 'Render' function
*** Controller
**** Takes input from user and sends to other two
**** asks model to update data or view to update look
*** example
* Node backend analysis
does anything else need to be added?
** TODO check up on security of server
** TODO check quality of middleware for server 

* Model View Controller specific
** Model
*** needs to set/get username
*** set/get users present?
*** set/get message
**** set message text to blank after
*** set/get history?
*** Needs to be able to talk to server
**** different class for network
***** set/get information 
** View 
*** display message box 
*** display username input
*** display received messages
*** display users present
** Controller
*** send username to model
*** send messages to user
*** send username to view
*** send messages to view 
*** perform any other event handlers
** Network 
*** needs to know when new user joins, alert (model/controller)
*** needs to (read/access) configuration
**** get address, port, uri
*** 

* Plan
when new user joins, add names to array, increase count of users present
Model alerted to new users by network class
When server receives username, name is sent to all clients. Clients must add name to vector
Client will know based off of json tags, who is a user vs other stuff, like messages
                                                                                                      

* Client.h** parse json tags to determine what is message, user, etc
*** if message: pass to model with get message method
*** if new user: pass to model with get new user method
** connect to server
*** handle errors
**** if json doesn't have correct keys/values: print entire json to error file
*** send disconnect


* guiFactory.h
** virtual or override functions?
*** virtual functions that use the override keyword
** what methods will I need 
*** does the scrolling in ncurses need to be done manually?
*** print message to window
*** print new user to window
*** maybe add more later
**** Get the data types for each method 

* Deadline today
** DONE finish client.h
   CLOSED: [2018-10-06 Sat 15:27]
** DONE rename to network.h
   CLOSED: [2018-10-06 Sat 15:27]
** TODO begin testing network.h with virtual network
** TODO Design factory method for gui, work on ncurses version

client needs to send all messages to model
Model needs to distinguish between local user message (to be sent) and remote user message (to be printed)


if type is message, set a tuple with name and message, pass to setRemoteUserMessage
change setRemoteUserMessage to accept tuple of strings
push into vector of tuples


use stringify to print entire object to error file
needs ostream, put ostream in file?
